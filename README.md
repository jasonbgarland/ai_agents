# AI Agents Learning Project

This project is a collection of AI agents built for learning and experimenting with AI agent development. Each agent is designed to explore different aspects of autonomous systems, from simple task automation to complex reasoning and decision-making.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains the source code for all AI agents
- `tests/` - Contains test files for agent functionality
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for the project

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Navigate to any agent's directory to explore its functionality and run examples.
