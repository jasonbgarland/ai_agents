# AI Agent Capabilities to Explore

Here are some AI agent capabilities to explore in future projects:

- **Memory/State Management** - Agents that remember past interactions and maintain context
- **API Integration** - Connecting to external services and APIs
- **Multi-step Reasoning** - Breaking down complex problems into smaller steps
- **Tool Usage** - Agents that can use various tools and utilities
- **Real-time Processing** - Handling live data streams and events
- **Data Analysis** - Processing and analyzing datasets
- **Web Scraping** - Extracting information from websites
- **File Processing** - Reading, writing, and manipulating files
- **Decision Trees** - Complex conditional logic and decision making
- **Natural Language Processing** - Understanding and generating human language
- **Structured Outputs** - Generating formatted data (JSON, XML, etc.)
- **Workflow Automation** - Orchestrating multi-step processes
- **Error Handling & Recovery** - Graceful failure management
- **Scheduling & Timing** - Time-based triggers and actions
